# Food harbour app

Food Harbour is a comprehensive online platform that serves as a catalogue of local restaurants in Hong Kong. It is designed to help customers find the best dining option based on their budget, preferred location, specific food preferences and restairant's rating. The app also provides its users with an opportunity to rate restaurants and leave a feedback for a particular restaurant as well as view the reviews written by others.

## How to use the app

1. Guest users can browse the restaurants catalog, view any restaurant's info, read the previosly written reviews. However they are not able to write their own reviews or add a restaurant to their saved list.

2. To unlock full functionality of the app, including the ability to leave reviews and add restaurants to their saved list, users must create an account / log in by clicking the "Log in" button on the navbar and filling out the required information, such as email and password.

3. On the home page, the recent activity on the platform is displayed, showing the most recent reviews. When users click on a restaurant's name in the review card, they will be redirected to the restaurant's page, which provides more information, such as phone number and address.

4. On the restaurants page, accessible by clicking "Restaurants" on the navbar, users can view a list of all restaurants. By default, the list is sorted by highest rating, meaning the best-rated restaurants appear at the top. If the user wishes to sort the restaurants by price or most recent review, they may do so by clicking "sort by" button and selecting the desired option.
